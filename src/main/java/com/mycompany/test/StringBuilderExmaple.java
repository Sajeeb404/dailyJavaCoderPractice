public class StringBuilderExmaple {

//    Java StringBuilder class is used to create mutable (modifiable) String. The Java StringBuilder class is same as
//            StringBuffer class except that it is non-synchronized. It is available since JDK 1.5.




    /*Similar Methods: StringBuffer and StringBuilder have many methods that serve the same purpose.

    Thread Safety: The key difference lies in thread safety, with StringBuffer
    being synchronized and StringBuilder being faster due to its lack of synchronization.*/
